=== Various notes on different decisions made ===

== 5/14/12 Using with LLVM - rwhelan ==
-When building LLVM, run 'REQUIRES_RTTI=1 make' to allow QEMU and LLVM libraries
to link together properly.

== 5/15/12 Global env in register - rwhelan ==
-In order to accomodate compilation with Clang, the S2E guys disabled the
register placement of the CPUState (as seen in dyngen-exec.h).  We decided to go
along with this, even though we aren't compiling with Clang.  Now, it is
declared in op_helper.c, with #ifdefs for CONFIG_LLVM dealing appropriately with
the CPUState.

== 5/16/12 LLVM with other architectures - rwhelan ==
-In order to enable LLVM on the back end of new architectures, changes need to
be made to target-*/helper.c, target-*/op_helper.c, and target-*/translate.c.
To see what these changes are, grep for CONFIG_LLVM in these files for i386 or
ARM.
