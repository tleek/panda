In order to build PANDA, we have a build.sh script in both LLVM and QEMU
directories with default options.  First, run build.sh in the LLVM directory,
and then run build.sh in the QEMU directory.  Feel free to tweak the default
options, but we recommend building LLVM and QEMU with the same compiler.  In
order to build some of the PANDA plugins inside of the QEMU directory, a
compiler that supports C++11 is required.
