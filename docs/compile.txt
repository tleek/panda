In order to build PANDA, we have a build.sh script in both LLVM and QEMU
directories with default options.  First, run build.sh in the LLVM directory,
and then run build.sh in the QEMU directory.  Feel free to tweak the default
options, but we recommend building LLVM and QEMU with the same compiler.  In
order to build some of the PANDA plugins inside of the QEMU directory, a
compiler that supports C++11 is required.

PANDA is known to build on debian 7 linux with the following steps.

1. Install some prereqs.

apt-get install build-essential 
apt-get build-dep qemu

2. Compile LLVM part.

cd panda/llvm-3.0
sh ./build.sh

This may take a while.

3. Compile & install distorm

follow instructions in distorm-read-only/INSTALL

3. Compile Qemu part.
